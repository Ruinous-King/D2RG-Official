						<h2>Encounter 1: Cataclysm</h2>
							<a class="center-img"><img src="images/destiny-icons-master/explore/quest_flag.svg" alt="Encounter 1: Cataclysm" width="160" height="160"></a>
						<h3>Light Network Creation</h3>
							<p>Create a network of nodes while killing Psions and Tormenters. There are four networks to complete with each network containing five to seven nodes. Completing a network stops the Sweeping Terror debuff for a moment while you reposition for the next network. While this is happening, a pair of Psions spawn that summon a Tormentor when defeated. Destroying the Tormentor extends the Sweeping Terror timer.</p>
						<h3>Role Breakdown</h3>
							<p>Network Connectors<br>These players are responsible for handling the Field of Light buff and locating the next node in the network, and activating it. Standing in the aura and shooting the completed node grants the Field of Light buff. Move to the next node indicated by the white beam on the orb to the next location. Find the next node in the sequence. Repeat til node completion.</p>
							<p>Crowd Control Team<br> These players are responsible for handling the enemies hordes that spawn continously. This team also spawns Tormentors and removes them to extend the Sweeping Terror debuff timer</p>
						<h3>Tips &#38; Tricks</h3>
							<p>Two players collect the Field of Light buff from the starting node and work together to complete the network. Remaining four players defeat Psions and Tormentors. Ideally the fours players should maintain all enemy control with their abilities and their weaponry whilst the two players complete the nodes.<br> Ths encounter can be completed quicker by juggling the node connector roles but this requires experience</p>

						<h2>Encounter 2: Scission </h2>
							<a class="center-img"><img src="images/destiny-icons-master/explore/quest_flag.svg" alt="Encounter 2: Scission" width="160" height="160"></a>
							<h3>Light &#38; Dark Network Creation</h3>
								<p>Create a network of nodes that crisscrosses a chasm.Activate all Light and Darkness plates across three different floors across a chasm.  Upon Clearing a floor a Major Redolence will spawn and when defeated will allow the team to move to the next floor. Repeat til completion.</p>
							<h3>Role Breakdown</h3>
							<h4>Divide your team into two groups.</h4>
								<p>Network Connectors<br>These players are responsible for handling the Field of Light buff/Flux of Darkness and locating the next node in the network. Standing in the aura and shooting the completed node grants the Field of Light buff or Flux of Darkness. Move to the next nod by crossing the chasm to next plate. Find the next node in the sequence. Repeat til node completion. Crossing the chasm requires the use of jump lifts avaliable at the edges of arenas.</p>
								<p>Crowd Control Teams<br> Two teams of two Guardians. These players are responsible for handling the enemies hordes that spawn continously. Due to Redolence enemies, players will need to stand near aura nodes with the node connectors to gain the buff. This then lets the crowd control team deal with the Redolence enemies.</p>
							<h3>Tips &#38; Tricks</h3>
								<p>No Tormentors, replaced with Redolence enemies that are vulnerable to damage when carrying correct buff.<br>Call for your crowd control team to gain the necessary buffs to deal with Redolence enemies.</p>

						<h2>Jumping Puzzle</h2>
							<a class="center-img"><img src="images/destiny-icons-master/explore/quest_flag.svg" alt="Root Of Nightmares Jumping Puzzle " width="160" height="160"></a>
						<h3>Traverse the Environment</h3>
							<p>Small Jumping Puzzle that requires you to navigate some moving environment pieces and platforms. Some enemies are in this sectionbut no strategy is needed.</p>	
						<h3>Tips &#38; Tricks</h3>
							<p>A sword is useful for third person point of view for easier navigation of the puzzle.</p>

						<h2>Encounter 3: Macrocosm</h2>
							<a class="center-img"><img src="images/destiny-icons-master/explore/quest_flag.svg" alt="Encounter 3: Macrocosm" width="160" height="160"></a>
							<h3>Align the Lost Planets</h3>
								<p>Defeating Honored Centurions spawns Terrestrial Lieutenants. Defeating a Lieutenant will give that player the Planetary Insight buff which. This buff specifically only lets the player see the planets where the Lieutenant spawned. Look at the planets and call out the position of the ones that do not match. The right side will have two Light planets and the left side will have two Darkness planets as the odd ones out. Stand below the odd planets and interact with it to move them. Cross to the other side of the room and deposit it where your partner picked up their planet. When all four planets are slotted in and essentially swapped to their correct sides, then the planets will be indexed. Gain Planetary Insight again. Planetary Insight can now see the true color of the three planets in the center of the arena.</p> 
								<p>There are only be two patterns: two Light and one Darkness or two Darkness and one Light. The position of the planets corresponds to the plates on the ground. Collect any matching planet from the sides of the room and deposit it into the matching plate.When the planets have been deposited, a damage phase will begin. Stand on the plate that matches the bossâ€™ shield to deal increased damage. When the boss is immune, go to the next plate. Repeat until all the plates are done.At each plate, you must deal enough damage to reach the notch in the bossâ€™ health bar. If you fail to reach this notch, you will not be able to use all plates. Repeat the whole process until you reach the final stand. At this point, you will still need to stand on plate that matches the bossâ€™ shield to deal increased damage.</p>
							<h3>Role Breakdown</h3>
							<h4>Divide your team into three groups.</h4>
								<p>Close Planet Team<br>These players are responsible for handling the planets on the left side of the arena.</p>
								<p>Far Planet Team<br>These players are responsible for handling the planets on the right side of the arena.</p>
								<p>Crowd Control Team<br> These players are responsible for handling the enemies hordes that spawn continously. </p>
							<h3>Tips &#38; Tricks</h3>
								<p> Use acroynm names of R1, R2, R3, L1, L2 and L3 for the planets to ensure communication is better delivered by the group.</p>

						<h2>Encounter 4: Nezarec, Final God of Pain</h2>
							<a class="center-img"><img src="images/destiny-icons-master/explore/quest_flag.svg" alt="Encounter 4: Nezarec" width="160" height="160"></a>
							<h3>Defeat Final God of Pain</h3>
								<p>Create the two networks of nodes. The faster networks are created, the sooner damage phase occurs. The Light nodes are on the left and the Darkness nodes are on the right. While this is happening, Nezarec will be standing up on his platform and then roaming around the battlefield. Nezarec begins roaming once his shoulders and chest are shot while heâ€™s up on the platform. When roaming, he must be stunned by shooting his chest. If you fail to stun him, Nezarec will perform a team wipe. This wipe can only be survived by standing in a Darknessâ€™s Refuge or Lightâ€™s Refuge.</p>
								<p> When both connections are completed, group up on a platform. Once Nezarec is blasted with a beam of light and damage phase will begin. After Nezarec becomes immune, reset your positions and repeat the process. On subsequent rounds, the building of the networks and Nezarecâ€™s chest cracking must be done even faster. The time between the start of a phase and the  wipe mechanic is much shorter. To create a Refuge to avoid a wipe, the team needs to know the colour Nezarecâ€™s shoulder when it breaks. As it breaks, it will glow either white or dark. This indicates the refugee needed. If his shoulder is Dark, Dark refuge needed. If his shoulder is Light, Light Refuge needed.This will create a safety zone.</p>
							<h3>Role Breakdown</h3>
							<h4>Divide your team into two groups.</h4>
								<p>Network Connectors<br>These players are responsible for handling the Field of Light buff/Flux of Darkness and locating the next node in the network. Standing in the aura and shooting the completed node grants the Field of Light buff or Flux of Darkness. Move to the next node. Repeat til node completion.</p>
								<p>Crowd Control Team<br> These players are responsible for handling the enemies hordes that spawn continously. </p>
							<h3>Tips &#38; Tricks</h3>
								<p>Dark Refuge is a Field of Light buff on Flux of Darkness node. Light Refuge is Flux of Darkness buff on Field of Lightnode. Refuges can prevent a wipe but resets Nezarec. </p>
